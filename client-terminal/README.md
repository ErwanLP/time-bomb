## TIME BOMB

- Type of game: Hidden identity card game.
- Number of players: 4-8 players.
- Duration of the game: 15 min.
- Age: 8+

### Goal of the game :

Moriarty has laid a bomb in Big Ben that he wants to explode and Sherlock wants to stop him.
  
At the beginning of the game, secretly discover which team you belong to and try to identify your partners:
  
Sherlock's team wins if she defuses the bomb.
Moriarty's team wins if the bomb explodes.

### Course of the game

The game takes place in 4 rounds maximum

#### Running a round


- The players talk to each other and announce the number of defusing cards they have. Players can bluff. This is not specified in the rule, but many players indicate at the beginning of the round the number of defusing cable cards they have in their game with a hand gesture (constellation of the fingers).
- When your choice is made, starting with the 1st player, take the Cutting Edge token (or the Cutting Edge card, as desired) and place it in front of the Cable Card you want to cut from another player.
- It is forbidden to cut your own cables.
- Reveal the Cut Cable Card in the center of the table.
- Secure Cable : If it is a secure cable : nothing happens.
- Defusal Card : If this is a Defusing Card:separate from the other revealed cards so that it is clearly visible. All Defusing Cards form a small pack. If you come across the last Defusing Card (there is one per player), the Sherlock team wins the game immediately.
- Bomb Card If this is the Bomb Card: the Moriarty team wins the game immediately.
- The player who reveals his Cable Card automatically takes the hand (symbolized by the Cutter) and proceeds in the same way.

#### End of a round

- The round ends when the number of Cable Cards revealed during the round is equal to the number of players.
- Gather all uncut Cables Cards (face down) in all players and shuffle them without looking at them.
- Distribute the Cable Cards again, face down, so that all players have the same number.
- Repeat step 5 of the set up.
- At each new round, each player has one less card than at the beginning of the previous round.
- A new round begins and the last player to receive the cutting pliers token during the previous round becomes the first player.

#### Game over

The game ends immediately if one of the following three conditions is fulfilled:

- All defusing Cables revealed (one number per player). The Sherlock team wins the game immediately.
- The bomb is revealed. The Moriarty team wins the game immediately.
- At the end of the 4 rounds, none of the two previous conditions is reached. The Moriarty team wins the game.
